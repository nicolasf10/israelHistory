1765 BCE —1523 BCE
Patriarchs Era
According to biblical accounts, the history of the Hebrew people began approximately 4,000 years ago (17th century BCE) with Abraham, his son Isaac, and his grandson Jacob—the three patriarchs of Judaism and central figures in Christianity and Islam.
Documents discovered in Mesopotamia, dating back to 2000-1500 BCE, corroborate aspects of their nomadic lifestyle described in the Hebrew Bible (Tanach). In the book of Genesis (12:1), it is reported how Abraham was called from Ur (of the Chaldeans) to Canaan to form a new people with the belief in one God. Abraham arrived in Canaan with Sarah, his wife, who was barren and could not have children, and allowed Abraham to have a child with his maid, Hagar, so that his husband's seed would continue. Thus, they had a son named Ishmael. But this son was not the only one Abraham had. At the age of 100 and at 90 years old, Sarah became pregnant and had a male child named Isaac.
When Isaac grew up, he took as his spouse a woman named Rebecca, with whom he had twin sons, Esau and Jacob, who were blessed to continue the family's lineage. On the map, we see the journey of the first patriarch, Abraham, from Ur in Chaldea to the land of Canaan.
According to the three faiths, the remains of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Sarah, Rebecca, and Leah are buried in the city of Hebron, while those of Rachel are near the entrance to Bethlehem.

Era of the Enslavement of the Jewish People in Egypt. The Land of Israel is under Egyptian Domination.
Jacob had two wives, Leah and Rachel, and, along with them and two concubines, had twelve sons and one daughter (named Dinah). When famine struck Canaan, Jacob, now known by his name Israel, along with his twelve sons and their families, settled in Egypt, where their descendants were subjected to slavery and forced labor. Two versions of the Bible mention the years the children of Israel were in Egypt. According to the account in the Book of Exodus, the people were enslaved for 430 years (12:40), while the account in Genesis states it was 400 years of slavery (15:13). Similarly, it was in Egypt that the children of Israel were first called a "people." It is said that 70 people came with Jacob, and after four centuries, 600,000 left (Exodus 12:37).
There are various archaeological discoveries associated with the presence of Jews in Egypt, among which the Merneptah Stele stands out—an ancient inscription erected by Pharaoh Merneptah, the son of Ramses II, around 1207 BCE, which is considered one of the earliest extrabiblical references to the people of Israel in that territory. The relevant part of the inscription states:
The princes are prostrated, saying: 'Mercy!' None raises their head among the Nine Bows. Desolation is for Tehenu; Hatti is pacified; Canaan is plundered with all evil; Ashkelon is taken; Gezer is seized; Yanoam is made as if it does not exist; Israel is devastated, its seed is no more.

The Exodus in Egypt (the 40-year Route in the Desert)
After approximately 400 years of slavery in Egypt, the people of Israel were led to freedom by Moses, who, according to the biblical narrative, was chosen by God to take his people out of Egypt and return to the Promised Land of Israel, promised to their ancestors. They wandered in the Sinai Desert for forty years, forming a nation and receiving the Ten Commandments, giving shape and substance to their monotheistic faith. The Exodus from Egypt (1300 BCE) left a fundamental mark on the collective unconscious of the Jewish people and became a symbol of freedom and redemption. Annually, during the Jewish festivals of Passover (Pessach), Shavuot, and Sukkot, the events that occurred during this period are celebrated.

Period of Judges and Kings in the Land of Israel
The Conquest of Jericho
After the death of Moses, Joshua (Yehoshua bin-Nun) took leadership of the people, who, unlike Moses, played a role, among others, as a military leader. Under his command, the people had to reconquer the land that other peoples inhabited. The first territory conquered was the city of Jericho, which, according to modern archaeological excavations, is one of the oldest cities in civilization, serving as the backdrop for various episodes described in the sacred texts of the three monotheistic religions.
As the years passed, through processes of social, political, and economic transformation and consolidation, other territories in the land of Israel were conquered. Periods of relative peace were interrupted by times of war, during which the people rallied behind leaders known as "judges," chosen for their political and military abilities and leadership skills.
Interestingly, Jericho was also the first territory to be handed over to the Palestinians by Israel as part of the Oslo Accords in 1994.

The Division of the 12 Tribes
After the definitive conquest of the territory, Joshua, before his death, divided the land among the 12 tribes of Israel, traditionally considered to be descendants of the twelve sons of Jacob (also known as Israel): Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Dan, Naphtali, Gad, Asher, Issachar, Zebulun, Joseph, and Benjamin. The distribution was done by lot, and the amount of land necessary for the population of each tribe was taken into account. According to Jewish faith accounts, divine instructions were given to Joshua. Various discoveries at archaeological sites in the region, such as Jericho, Ai, and Hazor, help validate events described in the biblical narrative of the conquest of the Promised Land and corroborate the Jewish presence in the region during this period.
During this time, which lasted approximately 300 years, the Jewish people did not have centralized leadership. Still, they were guided and led, especially in times of difficulty, by the judges (such as Deborah, Samson, Othniel, Gideon, and Jephthah).

The Kingdoms: Saul (Shaul)
The inherent weakness of their tribal organization, due to greater susceptibility to enemy attacks (which were already frequent) and internal conflicts among the leadership of each tribe, created the demand for a ruler who could unite the tribes and transform their position into a permanent one, with authority passed down by inheritance.
Thus began the monarchical period in the territory. The first king, Saul (Shaul, 1020 BCE), marked the phase of reorganizing the kingdom—which was no longer tribal—and establishing a complete monarchy through his successor, David. King David (David HaMelech, 1004-965 BCE) transformed his kingdom into a significant power in the region through successful military expeditions, inflicting the final defeat on the Philistines and through a network of friendly alliances with neighboring kingdoms. Internally, he united the twelve tribes of Israel into one kingdom, placing Jerusalem and the monarchy at the center of the country's national life. David was succeeded by his son Solomon (Shlomo, 965-930 BCE), who further strengthened the kingdom. Through treaties with neighboring kings and politically motivated marriages, Solomon ensured peace within the kingdom's borders and elevated it to the status of the great powers of the time. In the second month of the fourth year of his reign, the construction of the First Temple began, which was completed only in 924 BCE.

The division:
Great discontent among the population marked the end of Solomon’s reign, who paid heavily for his ambitious plans. At the same time, the preferential treatment of his own tribe irritated the others, resulting in growing antagonism between the monarchy and tribal separatists. After Solomon’s death (930 BCE), an open insurrection against his son, the successor Rehoboam, led to the secession of the ten northern tribes, which proclaimed Jeroboam as their king, and the division of the country into a northern kingdom, Israel, and a southern kingdom, Judah— the latter in the territory of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin.
The Kingdom of Israel, with its capital in Samaria, lasted more than 200 years under the authority of 19 kings. In comparison, the Kingdom of Judah was ruled from Jerusalem for 400 years by the same number of kings from the lineage of David. The expansion of the Assyrian and Babylonian empires led to the domination of Israel and then Judah.
The Kingdom of Israel was destroyed by the Assyrians (722 BCE), and its people were taken into exile and forgotten. More than a hundred years later, Babylon conquered the Kingdom of Judah, exiling most of its inhabitants and destroying Jerusalem and the Temple (586 BCE).

722 BCE - 598 BCE
Assyrian Period
The Neo-Assyrian Empire (the fourth and penultimate stage of ancient Assyrian history) achieved unprecedented success, not only due to its ability to expand but also, perhaps primarily, due to its capacity to efficiently incorporate conquered lands into its administrative system. The direct governance policy of Tiglath-Pileser III (745–727 BCE), instead of organizing through vassal states, brought significant changes to the Assyrian state, both socially and economically. However, his son and successor, King Shalmaneser V (727-722 BCE), was responsible for the conquest of the Kingdom of Israel, making King Hoshea his vassal.
Only after King Hoshea was caught in an act of treason (for not paying taxes and tributes for years) and imprisoned for nine years the Assyrian king captured Samaria, definitively conquering the Kingdom of Israel. He deported the Israelites to Assyria and settled them in Halah, by the rivers Habor and Gozan, and in the cities of Media, in order to disintegrate local identities (making the local regions less prone to rebellion), reinforcing the phenomenon of the ten lost tribes of Israel.

598 BCE - 538 BCE
Babylonian Exile
King Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon attacked Jerusalem in 598 BCE, plundering the Temple and initiating an exile of more than 10,000 Jews. In 586 BCE, another attack occurred, resulting in the deportation of over 40,000 people and the complete destruction of Solomon's Temple. This period marked the end of the Kingdom of Judah and the beginning of the exile in Babylon.
In Babylon, the Jews were settled around Nippur, enjoying community autonomy and religious freedom, integrating into the economic life of the empire while maintaining their Jewish identity. Despite adopting Aramaic, they did not mingle with pagan populations. They thrived in various occupations, becoming merchants and financiers and holding prominent positions in the Babylonian court, such as Daniel, Chanakya, Michael, and Azariah, descendants of the royal family of the Kingdom of Judah and Nehemiah.
The Beit Midrash (house of study) replaced the Temple, and religious observances, especially prayer and fasting, became prominent. The synagogue became essential in Jewish life, symbolizing spiritual and religious democracy. Influenced by Ezekiel, the Jews established study houses in Babylon, keeping the Jewish tradition alive.

Return of the Jews to the Land of Israel - Persian King Cyrus II, the Great
In 539 BCE, the Persian king Cyrus II, the Great, entered Babylon victoriously. Less than a year later, he issued a decree allowing the Jews to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the Temple. The king also authorized them to take the sacred objects from the Temple the Babylonians had captured.
It was a moment of joy for the Jews, who had long dreamed of returning to the Land of Israel and rebuilding the Temple. But how many of them would return? In Babylon, they lived comfortably. Furthermore, they knew that returning to the Land would mean facing numerous difficulties. The Jews who still lived in the Land of Israel—those who had not been taken captive—were poor, and thus, large sums would be needed for the reconstruction of Jerusalem and the Temple.
In 538 BCE, approximately 42,000 Jews left Babylon for Jerusalem, led by Zerubbabel. They brought their belongings and the gold and silver donations from the Jewish community and the king. However, upon arriving in the Land of Israel, the joy of returning to their homeland dissipated in the face of the harsh realities that prevailed. The following years were marked by conflicts, misunderstandings, and aggression from non-Jewish inhabitants, who did not look favorably upon the Jews' return to the Land of Israel. Finally, in the year 516 BCE, nearly 21 years after the return, the construction of the Second Temple was completed. The inauguration occurred, as prophesied, 70 years after the First Temple had been destroyed.

332 BCE - 164 BCE
Hellenistic Period
The conquest of the Near East by Alexander the Great, between 333 and 331 BCE, marked the beginning of the Hellenistic period in the East and throughout the ancient world around the Mediterranean Sea, which included Judea. With Alexander's early death, as he left no heirs, his generals, the Diadochi, ended up fighting in an attempt to gain supremacy over the empire he left behind; nevertheless, the Jews would continue to experience years of Hellenistic influence. From 320-198 BCE, the land of Judea was under Ptolemaic control, and then from 198-167 BCE, it came under Seleucid dominance after Antiochus III of the Seleucid Empire and Philip V of Macedon made a pact to seize the Ptolemaic possessions outside of Egypt.
The territorial policy of the Seleucids was precisely the opposite of that of the Ptolemies: the rulers preferred large territorial units, following the model of the Persian satrapies, divided into numerous and changing provinces and districts. At the same time, the process of Hellenization of the East advanced vigorously, which involved the diffusion of Greek culture, language, and population, initiated by Alexander the Great. Still, it would encounter an obstacle: the Jewish people and culture, which had always been deeply rooted and traditional. It is undeniable that the Jews suffered various Hellenistic influences; however, they always posed a hindrance to the emperors.
This conflictual relationship peaked when Antiochus IV Epiphanes (175-164) appeared in Jerusalem in the context of the Sixth Syrian War against Ptolemy VI Philometor (181-145) to quell the disturbances there. He conquered the city twice, in 169 and 168 BCE, after the Romans prevented him, by ultimatum, from continuing the war against Egypt. Jerusalem became a Hellenistic military colony, and thus persecutions began against the Jews loyal to the Torah, sparked on December 6, 167 BCE, when Antiochus IV ordered the erection of an altar to Olympian Zeus on top of the great altar of sacrifices in the Temple: the "abomination of desolation" from the Book of Daniel (Dn 11:31; 12:11). This was the signal for the outbreak of the Maccabean Revolt.

165 BCE - 64 BCE
Hasmonean (Maccabean Dynasty)
In 175 BCE, Antiochus IV Epiphanes ascended to the throne of the Seleucid Empire and began an assimilation campaign against the inhabitants of Judea. In an effort to unify the Greek elements of his empire, Antiochus ordered the destruction of the Jewish faith and the Hellenization of the Jews. An edict was published imposing religious rituals on the Jews in Jerusalem under penalty of death. In their place, he installed a statue of Zeus at the Temple site and ordered that pigs be sacrificed there. These acts initiated the Maccabean Revolt, led by the priest Mattathias and his five sons. When Mattathias passed away in 166 BCE, his son Judas Maccabeus became the movement's leader. He led it to victory, putting an end to the religious sacrilege of Antiochus IV.
They recaptured Jerusalem, reclaimed the Holy Temple of Jerusalem, purified it, rebuilt the altar, and resumed religious services, reestablishing their independence in Judea under the rule of the Hasmoneans, which lasted from 140 to 63 BCE. However, about a century later, in 63 BCE, Pompey invaded Israel, and the territory came under Roman control.
