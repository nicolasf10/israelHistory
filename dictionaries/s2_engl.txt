64 BCE - Year 70 (CE)
Roman Conquest and the Destruction of the Second Temple
The Roman province of Syria was incorporated into the Roman Republic in 64 BCE by Gnaeus Pompey Magnus, a politician of the Gens Pompeia, after the defeat of the King of Armenia, Tigranes. In 135, following the Bar Kokhba Revolt, the province of Syria was founded with Judea, intending to form Syria-Palestine. In 415, due to the subordination of the Roman Emperor to the Diocese of the East (provinces of the Western Middle East between the Mediterranean Sea and Mesopotamia), Syria-Palestine was again divided into two. Only in the 630s did the Muslim conquest of Syria occur.
Aelia Capitolina, also known as the Colony of Aelia Capitolina, was a city built by the Roman Emperor Hadrian in 131 CE. The town was located on the site of the ruins of Jerusalem and was occupied by a Roman colony. The term “Aelia” comes from the gentile name of Emperor Hadrian, while “Capitolina” is a tribute to Jupiter Capitolinus. The founding of this city resulted from the defeat of the Bar Kokhba Jewish Revolt, whose members were prohibited from entering the city. This process of renaming the region sought to weaken the Jewish identity of the local population and extinguish the Jewish people’s connection to the territory (then and in the future).

The Destruction of the Second Temple
The Jewish people built the Second Holy Temple of Jerusalem on the ruins of the First Temple, and its destruction occurred on August 30, 70 CE, as a result of a Roman siege of Jerusalem during a Jewish rebellion against the Romans. The Temple was set on fire and demolished by Roman soldiers, who killed and enslaved thousands of the city's inhabitants. A small part of the outer wall of the Second Temple was not completely destroyed and became what we now know as the Western Wall (Kotel) – one of the most sacred and essential places for the Jewish people. A decade later, after the death of Titus, Emperor Domitian ordered the construction of an arch to commemorate the victories and achievements of his predecessor, inscribing in stone the capture of Jerusalem and the sacred objects plundered from the Temple. The Arch of Titus – as it is known – is located within the walls of the Old City of Jerusalem on the way to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.

The Bar Kokhba Revolt
	Simon Bar Kokhba (Shimon Bar Kochva) was the great leader of the last revolution in the Land of Israel against the Romans before the great exile of the Jewish people from their land. Disregarding his promises to rebuild the city of Jerusalem and reform the Temple, Emperor Hadrian decided to build a Roman city over the ruins of the Jewish capital and rename it Aelia Capitolina. He also changed the name of the region to Syria-Palestina in an attempt to erase the Jewish identity of the area. During this time, the Jews suffered from discriminatory laws and could not follow their customs.
In this environment, Simon decided to fight against the Romans. Many Jews (as well as other peoples) feared facing them and thought that a rebellion would lead to a massacre. Bar Kokhba and his soldiers, however, were extraordinarily fearless and said that, even if they were not sure of victory, they would not accept slavery.
Alongside Bar Kokhba was Rabbi Akiva, a great scholar of the Hebrew Bible. Rabbi Akiva's students were the soldiers of Simon and many others from all over the Land of Israel and the Diaspora. They fought bravely against the Romans, receiving help from the inhabitants of nearby Hebrew villages. The Roman forces were unable to confront them. Bar Kokhba's army conquered all of Judea and liberated Jerusalem.
The period of independence and sovereignty lasted only three and a half years. Still, its significant impact could be observed in the use of their own coin (the shekel), which served as a great symbol of Jewish autonomy. The last battle was at the Fortress of Betar. After a long and bitter struggle on both sides, the city returned to Roman hands.

Byzantine Era
	The Byzantine Empire was the continuation of the Roman Empire. Its great capital, Constantinople, was initially known as Byzantium. The eastern part of the Roman Empire managed to survive the separation and collapse of the Western Roman Empire, resulting in its survival and prosperity from the 5th century until it fell to the Ottoman Turkish Empire in 1453. The Byzantine Empire differs from the Roman Empire in that Greek culture gradually took root in the region instead of Latin, with its main characteristic being the shift from Roman polytheism to Greek Orthodox Christianity.
The borders of the Byzantine Empire changed throughout its existence. Between 527 and 565, during the reign of Justinian, the Empire reached its greatest territorial extent, covering North Africa, the Italian Peninsula, and parts of the Iberian Peninsula. Between 582 and 602, under the reign of Maurice, the eastern borders were expanded, and the north was stabilized; however, after his death, a two-decade conflict ensued, resulting in significant territorial losses due to the Muslim invasions of the 7th century. Between the 10th and 11th centuries, during the Macedonian Dynasty, the Empire expanded again. It lasted for another two centuries until its significant decline, with the loss of much of Asia Minor to the Turks in a battle in 1071.
During this period, the local Jewish population faced significant changes in their situation. Initially, under Byzantine rule, there was some degree of religious tolerance, allowing Jewish communities to coexist with Christian ones. However, discriminatory policies were implemented over time, especially during the reign of emperors like Justinian I. Restrictions were imposed on Jewish participation in public office, and attempts at forced conversion to Christianity were made. The growing Christian ecclesiastical influence, particularly in Jerusalem, led to the promotion of Christianity as the dominant religion in the region, which contributed to a relative decline in the Jewish presence and influence in the Land of Israel.

Arab Caliphate
	The Arab Caliphate is the Islamic form of monarchical government and represents the political leadership of the Islamic world. As head of state, the caliph is based on the concept of a successor to the political and religious authority of the Islamic prophet Muhammad.
The period of Arab caliphate over the Land of Israel began in the 7th century, following the Muslim conquest led by the Arabs during the Ridda Wars (Wars of Apostasy) and the conquest of the region by Islamic armies. The capture of Jerusalem by the Muslims occurred in 637 CE, during the caliphate of the second caliph, Omar ibn al-Khattab.
Muslim control over the region continued over the centuries, passing through different dynasties and periods of stability and instability. For example, the Umayyad and Abbasid dynasties ruled over the Land of Israel at various times. During these periods, significant constructions took place, including mosques and other Islamic monuments, such as the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock, both located within the walls of the Old City of Jerusalem and built on the Temple Mount (the exact location as the Sacred Temple of Jerusalem).
Islamic rule was interrupted by periods of Christian governance during the Crusades, but the region returned to Muslim control with the arrival of the Mamluks in 1291.
During this period, Jews experienced a significant transformation in their situation (relative to Byzantine rule), receiving relative religious tolerance and autonomy, with permission to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the main synagogue, the Mountain Synagogue. The Arab caliphs adopted an approach of inter-religious coexistence, recognizing Jewish and Christian traditions. Although they were subject to special taxes (jizya), Jews were generally free to practice their faith and engage in community affairs. This period witnessed a cultural and intellectual renaissance, with Jewish scholars contributing to the region's flourishing of arts, sciences, and philosophy.

The Crusades
The Crusades were a series of military campaigns carried out by much of Christian Europe, especially France (under the Capetians) and the Holy Roman Empire, encouraged by the pope, the highest ecclesiastical authority of the Catholic Church. The Crusades took place over two centuries (1096 to 1291) and aimed to regain political and religious control of the Holy Land. The beginning of Christian control over the Land of Israel (intermittent and unstable) is commonly marked by the conquest of Jerusalem during the First Crusade in 1099, which until then was under the control of the Fatimid Empire (Arab-Muslim).
Encouraged by the victory at the Battle of 1071, the Turks conquered several territories in Asia Minor (including parts of the Land of Israel), prompting the declining Byzantine Empire to seek help from the Catholic Church (in order to contain Muslim threats), which catalyzed the Crusade movement. There were many geopolitical changes during this period, especially during the four main Crusades.
Although the period officially ended only in 1444 (with the Crusade of Varna), the last Crusade that conquered territories in the Land of Israel was the so-called "People's Crusade" or "Crusade of the Poor," which occurred between 1217 and 1221. This crusade was an attempt to renew the fight after the fall of Jerusalem to Saladin in 1187 during the Third Crusade. However, the Crusade of the Poor was unsuccessful in reclaiming Jerusalem; instead, it captured some coastal cities in the region, such as Caesarea and Jaffa. The advance inland, including to Jerusalem, was impeded, and the Crusaders failed to establish a lasting presence in the region. This event is considered one of the last organized attempts by Christian forces to reclaim territories in the Holy Land during the Crusades.
During the period of the Crusades in the Land of Israel, Jewish communities faced a complex reality due to the ongoing conflicts between Christian and Muslim forces. Jewish communities grew but were also targets of violence, facing massacres and pogroms, especially during the First Crusade. Despite the tensions, there were moments of relative coexistence, especially under Muslim rulers, allowing Jews to participate in trade and cultural life.

The Mameluk Rule
The Mamluk rule over the Land of Israel began in the 13th century when Mamluk forces, composed of enslaved warriors who rose to power, took control of the region. After the defeat of the Crusaders and the fall of Acre in 1291, the Mamluks consolidated their dominance over most of Palestine, Syria, and Egypt. During the Mamluk period, the region experienced relative economic stability and prosperity but faced external threats, such as the Mongol invasions led by Tamerlane in the late 14th century.
The Mamluks exercised their control from their capitals, Cairo and Damascus, and established administrative and military policies to maintain order and protect the region. However, Mamluk's rule also witnessed internal conflicts, succession disputes, and external challenges, including the advances of the Ottoman Empire, which ultimately conquered the territory in 1517.
During this period, Jews faced a complex dynamic. Initially, the situation for Jews improved compared to the preceding Crusader period. The Mamluks, being a military class of slave origin, implemented more tolerant policies, allowing Jewish communities to re-establish themselves in Jerusalem and other parts of the region. However, this relative tranquility was frequently interrupted by periods of instability and events like the Black Death, which generally affected the population. Despite the challenges, some Jewish communities flourished, especially in Safed (Tzfat), becoming centers of Jewish study and culture. The Mamluk period also witnessed the expansion of the prestige and influence of Jewish scholars, including Rambam (Maimonides).

Turkish-Ottoman Empire
The rule of the Turkish Ottoman Empire over the Land of Israel began in the 16th century when Sultan Selim I conquered the region, including Jerusalem, in 1517. Palestine became an integral part of the vast empire for centuries, experiencing relative stability under Ottoman control. Jerusalem, in particular, was marked by the construction of notable structures, such as the walls of the Old City and its eight gates, by Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent between 1535-1542, and Mishkenot Sha'ananim, the first Jewish neighborhood outside the walls, in 1860.
During this period, most of the Jewish population in the region concentrated in Jerusalem, Safed (Tzfat), and Tiberias (Tvéria), which were very important for the Jewish religion. Despite challenges and limitations in terms of legal status and socioeconomic conditions, the Jewish presence in the region played a significant role in the cultural and religious landscape, with the continuity of educational institutions and spiritual practices, and several Jews were also involved in commercial, agricultural, and artisanal activities, contributing to the local economy.
However, over time, the empire faced decline and increasing pressure from European powers. The end of Ottoman rule in the region occurred with the conclusion of World War I when the Ottoman Empire was defeated, and the British Mandate was established, marking a new phase in the history of the Land of Israel.
