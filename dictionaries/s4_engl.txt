1948-1949
Declaration of Independence of the State of Israel
	The proclamation of the independence of the State of Israel took place on May 14, 1948, in the city of Tel Aviv. David Ben-Gurion, then leader of the Jewish Agency and head of the Zionist leadership (the Yishuv), declared the establishment of the State of Israel. The event occurred one day before the end of the British Mandate in Palestine, as determined by UN General Assembly Resolution 181.
This was a crucial moment in Israel's history and followed the withdrawal of British authorities from the region. The document, known as the Declaration of Independence of Israel, was drafted by a committee led by David Ben-Gurion and emphasized the millennia-long connection of the Jewish people to the Land of Israel, the commitment of the new state to "the principle of freedom, justice, and social peace," and its aspiration to be "an example to the nations in the quest for human freedom" and its desire "to live in peace and cooperation with the neighboring countries."
The declaration marked the end of the British Mandate in Palestine and the beginning of the State of Israel. The following day, on May 15, 1948, military forces from five neighboring Arab countries (Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, and Jordan) invaded Israel, marking the start of the Israeli War of Independence.

The Jewish Refugee Crisis
After the War of Independence, Jewish sovereignty was reestablished in that land for the first time in two thousand years. However, the redrawing of borders led to the forced displacement of both Arab and Jewish populations. While the displacement of Palestinian Arabs to areas under Jordanian and Egyptian control is widely remembered, the expulsion of over nine hundred thousand Jews from Arab countries in retaliation for the Jewish victory in the region is often forgotten.

Before the establishment of the State of Israel, Jews were spread across various Arab countries, especially in North Africa, Iraq, Iran, and Turkey. By the late 1940s, approximately 90% of these Jews were expelled from their homes and had their properties confiscated by local governments. The peak of these expulsions occurred in 1956, during the Suez Crisis. Of the nine hundred thousand Jews forced to leave their homes, around 650,000 were absorbed by the State of Israel between 1948 and 1979. However, due to the structural challenges of the young state in its early years, many were settled in large absorption camps, known as ma'abarot.

1949
The 1949 Armistice (The Green Line)
	Given the frustrated attempt to eradicate the Jewish presence in the region alongside the establishment of a large Arab state, an armistice was signed in 1949 between Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria. This agreement aimed not to establish permanent borders but to cease hostilities and define temporary demarcation lines until a final deal could be reached. These limits became known as the "Green Line" and served as a starting point and reference in various territorial negotiations over the years.
The land "inside the line" included almost all the territories designated for the Jewish state under the Partition Plan, except for a small area in the southern Beit Shean Valley. However, it also encompassed a significant portion of the area allocated for the Arab state (according to Resolution 181). Additionally, Hamat Gader and Snir (on the northeastern coast of the Sea of Galilee), which were supposed to be Israeli, remained under Syrian military control.
After being attacked, Israel added 5,700 square kilometers to what had been allocated to it by the partition. By the war's end, the State of Israel extended over 20,770 square kilometers, accounting for 77% of the post-1922 Palestinian Mandate, excluding the West Bank (about 27,000 square kilometers) and 17.30% of the original land of Palestine (including Jordan). East Jerusalem (including the Old City and the holy sites) and the West Bank were captured by the Hashemite Emirate of Transjordan, while Egypt occupied the Gaza Strip. The other Arab state was never established. From this point on, the region historically known as Judea and Samaria became known as the West Bank — in contrast to Transjordan, referring to the banks of the Jordan River. The newly independent Kingdom's attempt to annex the region was recognized only by Pakistan, Iraq, and the United Kingdom and never gained legal validity in the international community.
Regarding the legal aspects of the 1949 Armistice, it is particularly relevant to highlight the following fact: it was not a source of rights and duties for local Jews, local Muslims, or any other parties involved at that time under territorial sovereignty. Article 2 states: "It is also recognized that no provision of this agreement shall in any way prejudice the rights, claims, and positions of either party in the peaceful final settlement of the Palestinian question. The provisions of this agreement are dedicated exclusively to military considerations." Thus, it is correct to argue that the Green Line is only relevant regarding the law of war and where the parties would refrain from conflict.
A few months after the end of the war, the Jewish population surged to one million following the arrival of hundreds of thousands of immigrants to Palestine between November 30, 1947, and the signing of the armistice agreements in July 1949. The non-Jewish (Arabic-speaking) population that decided to stay inside Israel’s borders totaled about 156,000 people.

1956
Crisis of Suez
	In 1956, Gamal Abdel Nasser, then president of Egypt, decided to close the Suez Canal, administered by Britain and France, declaring the canal's nationalization. At the time, Israel and Egypt had no diplomatic relations. Hence, the canal's nationalization posed a severe economic risk for the Jewish state, as the canal's closure prevented the passage of goods coming from the Arabian Sea through the Strait of Tiran, violating the 1949 armistice.
In response, Israel launched an offensive against Egypt, followed by the former canal administrators in what became known as "Operation Kadesh." Israel invaded the Sinai Peninsula and the Gaza Strip, while Britain and France sent paratrooper brigades to sink ships and regain control. However, both countries faced intense pressure, particularly from the United States, which called for a ceasefire, and from their civilian populations. During this operation, Israel occupied the invaded territories for four months before returning them to Egypt.

1964
Creation of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)
In January 1964, at a meeting of the Arab League in Cairo, it was decided to create an organization to consolidate the growing Palestinian national identity into an organized political movement (also before the international community). On May 28 of the same year, in Jerusalem, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) was established, which expressed in its early documents the desire for the destruction of the State of Israel. This does not mean that such severe feelings shape the current identity. Still, it is the historical account of its origin—as evidenced in its charter in Articles 2, 3, and 19 (where it states that British Palestine is an indivisible unit that must be liberated through armed struggle against the Zionist colonial movement), Articles 18-19 (which deny the moral claims, historical ties, and political rights of the Jewish people to their homeland), and Article 24 (where it recognizes that the Palestinian leadership does NOT have sovereignty over the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which at the time were under Jordanian and Egyptian control, respectively), making it absolutely clear which [part of] Palestine should be liberated and from whom.
In line with its fundamental charter, the PLO launched various terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians in the years following its foundation, with most of these originating from territories controlled by Jordan, Gaza, and Lebanon. In 1967, King Hussein of Jordan, fearing to lose power and retaliatory attacks from Israel against Jordan, closed the PLO offices in Jerusalem and arrested most of its members.
@
1967
Six-Day War (1967)
In September 1965, Arab leaders secretly met in Morocco to discuss an invasion of Israel. King Hassan II of Morocco was suspicious of the Arab League and recorded the meeting, delivering the recording to Mossad afterward. In the following years, Syria, extremely dissatisfied with Israel's plan to divert water from the Kinneret to the rest of the country, began attacking farms in northern Israel from the Golan Heights.
On the eve of the war, the Syrians had already mobilized their army in the north. At the same time, Egypt began moving troops into the Sinai and ended the Israeli-Egyptian organization monitoring the Suez Canal, as well as closing the Tiran Strait again. During 1967, tensions escalated until Israel launched a preemptive attack against Egyptian air forces. In retaliation, Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan attacked Israel, which responded and won the war in six days, conquering the Golan Heights (annexed through the “Golan Heights Law” on December 14, 1981), the Sinai (returned to Egypt during the 1980s under the Camp David Accords signed in 1978), the Gaza Strip (from which Israel unilaterally withdrew in 2005 after parliamentary approval), Judea and Samaria (territories still disputed and divided in the Oslo I and II Accords between 1993-1995), and East Jerusalem (fully integrated as the capital of Israel through the “Basic Law of Jerusalem” on July 30, 1980).

1973
Yom Kippur War (1973)
Despite Israel demonstrating military superiority over Arab countries in the 1967 war, Egypt and Syria decided to wage another war in 1973: the Yom Kippur War. The countries' leaders aimed primarily to regain the territories lost in the Six-Day War: the Sinai for Egypt and the Golan for Syria.
Thus, in October 1973, during the holiest day of Judaism (Yom Kippur - Day of Atonement), when it is customary to fast, the Egyptians and Syrians launched coordinated surprise attacks, managing to infiltrate from the south and north of Israeli territory. Due to the Jewish holiday, the Israeli army was not at its entire focus and strength, resulting in initially devastating outcomes for the Jewish nation.
However, after a few weeks of fighting, Israel managed to regain its territories in the north, fighting the Syrians, and in the south, fighting the Egyptians. The front against Egypt was the most difficult. Still, it yielded the best results, as seen when peace talks began and progressed significantly after the ceasefire agreement between the two countries, culminating in the Camp David Accords in 1979.

1978
Camp David Accords (1978)
In 1978, the newly elected Prime Minister of Israel, Menachem Begin, and Anwar Sadat, then President of Egypt, concluded their peace negotiations by signing the Camp David Accords, with the mediation of American President Jimmy Carter. The lengthy discussions, which included a visit from Sadat to Israel, resulted in the first peace agreement between Israel and an Arab country.
In exchange for peace with Egypt and recognition of its right to exist, Israel returned the Sinai Peninsula and also offered the Gaza Strip (territories that belonged to Egypt until the Six-Day War in 1967), but the agreement’s second part was refused. Menachem Begin and Anwar Sadat were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1978 as recognition of their attempts to achieve peace in the Middle East. The following year, in 1979, peace between Egypt and Israel was formalized and remains in effect to this day.
Although Israeli public opinion was divided after the formalization of the agreement, it proved to be very positive for Israel, as Egypt had always been a major, if not the greatest, enemy of the State of Israel, so this threat finally came to an end. It can be said that this agreement also opened the door for other significant peace treaties that Israel achieved in the following years. On the other hand, the reception in Egypt, particularly among Islamic fundamentalist groups, was not positive, being one of the leading causes of Anwar Sadat's assassination in 1981.

1980
Basic Law of Jerusalem
In 1980, the government of then-Prime Minister Menachem Begin approved the Basic Law of Jerusalem. This text officially designated unified Jerusalem as the one, eternal, and indivisible capital of the State of Israel. The law consisted of four fundamental points. The first stated that unified Jerusalem, which includes both the western and eastern parts reclaimed in 1967, is the capital of Israel, as was the case in the times of King David—the second reaffirmed Jerusalem as the official residence of the president, the parliament, the government, and the supreme court. The third guaranteed the security and protection of all the city's sacred sites for all religions, such as the Western Wall for Jews, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre for Catholics, and the Al-Aqsa Mosque for Muslims. The fourth included a plan for the city's development, including allocating funds and promoting activities.
Despite the unfavorable international repercussions at the time, including a veto from the UN Security Council, over time, many countries began to accept this law and recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, such as the United States in 2017, when it moved its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Domestically, the text was of extreme importance to reaffirm Israel's sovereignty over its capital and ensure its development.
In 2000, three new points were added to this Basic Law: the definition of the jurisdictional areas of Jerusalem, the non-transferability of Jerusalem's authority to anyone other than the Government of Israel or the Municipality of Jerusalem, and a guarantee that this Basic Law cannot be amended without the approval of two-thirds of the parliament.
@
1982
First Lebanon War
Over the years, the PLO built a strong presence in southern Lebanon, near the border with Israel. These groups initiated a series of attacks on northern Israel, primarily involving rocket fire. To combat it, the Israeli government launched Operation Peace for Galilee in 1982, aiming to remove PLO-linked militias from southern Lebanon, clear the region, and establish a security buffer to ensure the safety of communities in northern Israel.
However, this operation escalated, intensifying conflicts and the Israeli presence in the neighboring country, even reaching the capital, Beirut, leading to the First Lebanon War. As part of the strategy, Israel allied with Christian-Lebanese armed groups that shared the common interest of destroying PLO cells. However, one of these groups invaded Palestinian refugee camps and carried out a massacre known as the “Sabra and Shatila Massacre.” This incident had negative repercussions for Israel, stemming from accusations of negligence that are believed to have allowed or facilitated the massacre. Coupled with the high number of Israeli soldiers killed in the conflict (approximately 675), this created intense pressure on the Israeli government, contributing to the resignation of then-Prime Minister Menachem Begin in 1983.
Even after the war ended, Israel maintained a military presence in southern Lebanon until 2000, aiming to ensure security in northern Israel.
@
1987
First Intifada
After the Six-Day War, Israel maintained a policy of encouraging settlements in the territories of the Gaza Strip and Judea and Samaria, which had been conquered from Egypt and Jordan, respectively. At the same time, the process of consolidating the national identity of the Palestinian people was strengthened, particularly among the youth, who initiated a wave of protests against the Israeli presence in the region in 1987. The end of that year was also marked by two significant events: the Night of the Gliders in November, when Palestinian terrorists infiltrating from Lebanon killed six Israeli soldiers at the border, and a traffic accident involving an Israeli military vehicle that resulted in the deaths of four Palestinians. This incident, in particular, was the catalyst for the First Intifada (انتفاضة in Arabic, meaning "uprising" or "shaking"), also known as the Stone Intifada, named because young Palestinians used stones and Molotov cocktails against soldiers and Israeli army targets.
Due to the lack of centralized leadership, this uprising had a popular and somewhat disorganized character despite the involvement of terrorist groups such as Hamas and Islamic Jihad. During the first year of the rebellion, there was little use of weapons and effective violence by the Palestinians; however, over time, with the involvement of these terrorist groups, the conflict became bloodier. Attacks intensified, and what began as a popular uprising turned into a war against terror. One of the worst attacks was committed by a member of Islamic Jihad in 1989, who blew up a bus on line 405, killing 16 people. To combat these groups, Israel intensified its military presence in the areas where they operated, imposed curfews, and, in extreme cases, organized deportations. They also intensified the use of intelligence and military force to prevent infiltration and new attacks. In total, the attacks during this period killed more than 200 Israelis.
As expected, most of world public opinion turned to support the Palestinian side, mainly due to images of young people armed with stones facing heavily armed soldiers, even though this was the necessary reaction from Israel to maintain security in the country. Additionally, the UN passed several resolutions condemning Israel and calling for peaceful solutions to the conflict, as well as establishing a commission to investigate and examine the conflict.
The First Intifada ended in September 1993 with Yitzhak Rabin, then Prime Minister of Israel, and Yasser Arafat, founder and leader of the PLO, signing the Oslo Accords, which will be explained on the following map. After this conflict, the PLO emerged with international recognition as the representative of the Palestinian cause, while terrorist groups like Hamas grew and increased their support base among Palestinians.

1993-1994
Oslo Accords
In 1993, a historic event occurred that promised to change the entire conflict in the Middle East. Yitzhak Rabin, then Prime Minister, with the mediation of American President Bill Clinton, negotiated with Yasser Arafat and the PLO the Oslo Accords, which were interim agreements that would lead to the end of the conflict and the realization of the dreams of the Israeli peace left. In these accords, the PLO (from then on known as the Palestinian National Authority, or ANP) assured that it would remove from its charter (and its practices) the points that threatened to destroy Israel and the Jewish people. Nevertheless, both countries involved would still accept UN Resolution 242, which had three requirements: the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the territories conquered in 1967, the end of wars, and mutual recognition between the two countries. Upon completion of the first stage, within the framework of a peace agreement, the nations would still discuss a solution to the issue of Palestinian refugees and the division of Jerusalem.
Due to the accords, radical groups on both sides expressed their discontent. On the one hand, Palestinians who did not accept the recognition of Israel as a state intensified terrorist attacks, which some in society viewed as the price to pay for peace, while others imagined this would be the obvious outcome of the accords. Radical Israelis (motivated by the agreement and the attacks) responded in kind. This was the case of Baruch Goldstein, who carried out a massacre at the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron, killing 29 Palestinians. It is important to note here that while Palestinian terrorists were considered martyrs and celebrated by some, the Israeli government and the majority of the Israeli population condemned these acts.
Even after this significant wave of violence, Rabin and Arafat signed the Oslo Accords B, which were approved by the Israeli parliament with a minimal majority of 61 to 59. These accords divided Judea and Samaria into three zones: A, B, and C. In Zones A and B, the Palestinian Authority had political and administrative autonomy, while in Zone C, Israel would hold control. Regarding security, Israel retained control over areas B and C, while the Palestinian Authority managed internal affairs in zone A. The passage of people and goods between the zones was also under Israeli responsibility at checkpoints.
This territorial division was also meant to be provisional until, at some point, the territories' final status would be negotiated. It is worth noting that areas A and B represent approximately 40% of Judea and Samaria, while area C comprises the remaining 60%.
After Oslo B, political and social conflicts only intensified, culminating in the assassination of Rabin in 1995 by an Israeli Jew named Yigal Amir. The Palestinians also continued their attacks until, in 2000, the Second Intifada erupted.

1994
Israel and Jordan Peace Treaty
The 1990s were a period of significant changes in the Middle East, especially with the end of the Gulf War in 1991, which prompted a reevaluation of regional alliances. In this context, the Madrid Conference took place in 1991, aimed at finding paths to peace in the Middle East, a pivotal moment for Israel to discuss the issue with its Arab neighbors. Thus, the secret talks that began in 1990 between Israel and Jordan gained strong momentum.
With the mediation of American President Bill Clinton, on October 26, 1994, the Peace Agreements between Jordan and Israel were officially established, represented by Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli Prime Minister, and King Hussein, the monarch of Jordan. The agreement was signed in Wadi Araba, at the border between the two countries. Since then, both have become partners, particularly in tourism, with many Israelis traveling to Petra, for example, and in trade, with Israel exporting drinking water to Jordan. Relations were normalized, both embassies were opened, and Jordan became Israel's main ally in the region.
Less publicized but no less historically significant was a negotiation that took place the same year, on May 4, 1994, in Cairo: the Gaza-Jericho Agreement, which later became part of what was called Oslo II. Consequently, Israel began the construction of the first 60-kilometer barrier along its border with the Gaza Strip in 1994, completing it in 1996. Between December 2000 and June 2001, the barrier had to be rebuilt due to its destruction by Palestinians at the start of the Second Intifada in September of the same year, preceding a series of terrorist attacks that resulted in the deaths of over 1,000 Israelis.

2000
Camp David Summit (Ehud Barak’s Proposal)
In July 2000, then-Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak met with Arafat and Bill Clinton at Camp David to seek an end to the conflict and a final status for the territories of Judea and Samaria. To this end, he offered 91% of Judea and Samaria, the Gaza Strip, and a portion of East Jerusalem (including the Christian and Arab neighborhoods of the Old City and the Temple Mount - the esplanade of the mosques) to Arafat, who refused. Clinton and the Saudi prince agreed to state that the negotiations stalled due to Arafat's unwillingness. The map shows the last official Israeli offer proposed during the negotiations. There are unofficial reports that describe additional proposals that included a contiguous Palestinian territory, all of which were rejected by Arafat's leadership.
After the failure of the Camp David negotiations, the Second Intifada began. The Palestinian narrative states that the conflict started because Ariel Sharon walked on the esplanade of the mosques, which sparked a significant Palestinian uprising. However, the Palestinians themselves admit that this is a lie. Imad Falugi, Minister of Communications for the Palestinian Authority, has stated that while Sharon's actions were indeed the spark, the Intifada had been pre-planned since Arafat's return from Camp David.
Amid the Intifada in 2001, Ehud Barak made a new offer to the Palestinians during the Taba talks. In addition to what he had already offered at Camp David, Barak increased the territory of Judea and Samaria to 95% and agreed to accept up to 100,000 Palestinian refugees. Arafat again rejected the offer (further research on this topic is needed).
In response to the Intifada, the Israeli army launched Operation Defensive Shield, during which much of the institutional structure of the Palestinian Authority in Judea and Samaria was destroyed. Additionally, a security fence was constructed along the border of Judea and Samaria. However, only 5% of it is actually a wall, while the other 95% is a fence. Despite being referred to as an "apartheid wall" by anti-Semites, its sole purpose is security, resulting in a 99% decrease in terrorist attacks.

2005
Unilateral Disengagement from the Gaza Strip
Even without a partner for negotiation on the Palestinian side, Israel has always sought peace relentlessly. To demonstrate this, in 2005, the Israeli government decided to unilaterally withdraw from Gaza, meaning it left the territory without demanding anything in return. Prime Minister Ariel Sharon hoped to show that he was willing to do anything for peace. However, he received the exact opposite. Israeli soldiers were forced to evacuate approximately 8,000 Jews from their homes, some against their will.
The appeal for peace was met with terror. One year after the disengagement, in 2006, Hamas was democratically elected in the Palestinian elections. One year after the elections, in 2007, Hamas and Fatah entered into a military conflict in Gaza, which resulted in the deaths of not only combatants from both groups but also civilians and UN diplomats.
At the end of the conflict, it was determined that Hamas would govern the Gaza Strip, while the Palestinian National Authority (ANP) would govern Areas A and B of Judea and Samaria. Soon after the clashes, the two groups staged coups, self-determining as the rulers, authoritatively, in their respective regions.
In response to the undemocratic takeover by the terrorist group Hamas in the Gaza Strip, the Israeli government imposed a series of import restrictions, which are in accordance with international law.

2005
Second Lebanon War
In 2006, Hezbollah was carrying out numerous attacks against cities in northern Israel. However, despite the attacks, the Israeli government did not intend to enter Lebanese territory. This changed on July 12, when two Israeli soldiers were kidnapped and three were killed.
After deciding to go to war against Hezbollah (not Lebanon), Israel conducted numerous attacks on the terrorist group's command locations (many concentrated in civilian areas) and launched a ground invasion into southern Lebanon. Meanwhile, Hezbollah continued its bombardment strategies targeting civilian areas. By the end of the conflict, Hezbollah was significantly weakened; however, there were many civilian casualties on both sides, especially among the Lebanese.
The most beneficial peace proposal for the Palestinians occurred in 2008, with the Olmert Plan. After 36 meetings with Palestinian leadership between 2006 and 2008, the final proposal was similar to what Barak offered at Camp David, with the addition of a specific body to manage the holy sites, a bridge—exclusively for Palestinians—linking Gaza and Judea and Samaria, and territory equivalent to 100% of Judea and Samaria, with a 6% territorial "swap." The new leader of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, did not respond to the proposal.
@
2008
Olmert Plan
In 2008, then-Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert presented a peace proposal to the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), led by Mahmoud Abbas. This proposal was considered one of the most comprehensive ever made, offering around 93-94% of the West Bank for the establishment of a future Palestinian state. To compensate for the 6-7% of West Bank territory that Israel wanted to annex (including large blocs of Jewish settlements, marked in gray on the map), Olmert proposed a land swap, offering an equivalent area within Israel's sovereign territory (marked in beige on the map). Additionally, the proposal included a secure corridor linking the West Bank and Gaza Strip, creating territorial continuity for the Palestinian state. The proposal also included a special shared sovereignty arrangement over the Old City of Jerusalem, with an international governance system for holy sites, such as the Temple Mount/Al-Aqsa compound.

In territorial terms, Olmert's proposal differed from previous plans by offering Palestinians nearly the entire West Bank while aiming to retain strategic areas near Jerusalem and some larger settlements, compensated by land within Israel. Regarding Palestinian refugees, Olmert made a limited offer for a symbolic "return" of some to Israel, while other refugees could be resettled in the future Palestinian state or other countries with international financial support. The proposal also called for the demilitarization of the future Palestinian state, ensuring Israel's security along shared borders.

Olmert’s plan emerged from a phase of intense negotiations and his desire to advance the peace process after previous negotiations had stalled. However, the agreement never materialized, as Abbas never provided a formal response before Olmert left office amid a corruption investigation. The proposal, though never implemented, is often cited as a significant missed opportunity in attempts to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Additionally, the start of the Lebanon War in 2006 also halted progress in negotiations; this war was triggered by the kidnapping of Israeli soldiers by Hezbollah and involved intense fighting between Israel and the Lebanese terrorist group, which was supported by Iran and Syria.

2020
Abraham Accords
After unsuccessful attempts to make peace with the Palestinians, Israel decided to change its strategy and seek normalization of relations with more moderate Arab countries in the region. Through the mediation of the United States, under then-President Donald Trump, Israel issued the Declaration of the Abraham Accords on September 15, 2020. This declaration, named after the patriarchs of both religions (Islam and Judaism), announced the normalization of relations with Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates.
In addition to these two countries, Morocco and Sudan also later decided to normalize relations with the State of Israel. These accords marked a significant shift in the Arab-Israeli conflict, as they established that peace with the Palestinians is no longer seen as a prerequisite for peace with Arab nations. Instead, it is now viewed as something that these agreements will bolster.
The accords also included provisions for economic cooperation, security arrangements, and cultural exchanges, indicating a broader commitment to mutual interests. However, reactions from the Palestinian Authority and other Arab nations highlighted tensions, with many viewing the agreements as a betrayal of the Palestinian cause.
The next step that Israel intended to take was to achieve normalization of relations with Saudi Arabia, the leader of Sunni countries and one of the most powerful nations in the Arab world. However, the war with Hamas, following the brutal surprise attack initiated by the terrorist group on October 7, 2023, interrupted discussions between the two countries, which are expected to resume after the conflict ends.
