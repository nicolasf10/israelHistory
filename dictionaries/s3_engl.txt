1915-1916
McMahon-Hussein Correspondence
During World War I, Sir Henry McMahon, the British High Commissioner in Egypt, and Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca, exchanged correspondence known as the McMahon-Hussein Letters. These letters hold great historical significance due to their implications for the region's future, particularly concerning the British promise of support for Arab independence in exchange for cooperation against the Ottoman Empire.
In 1915 and 1916, McMahon exchanged several letters with Hussein, discussing the conditions under which the Arab Revolt against Ottoman rule could receive British support. McMahon made vague promises of an independent Arab state that would include areas that today comprise Syria, Iraq, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia, explicitly excluding the coastal areas of the Mediterranean, which include what is now Israel and Palestine.
Interpretations of the letters have been controversial, especially regarding the promise of Arab independence. After the war, the region's borders were redrawn by the Sykes-Picot Agreements (1916), the Balfour Declaration (1917), and the Transjordan Memorandum (1922), leading to discontent among Arabs, as some of the promises made in the letters were not fully honored. This situation contributed to tensions and challenges in the region and, in part, shaped the subsequent course of Middle Eastern history.

Sykes-Picot Agreement
The Sykes-Picot Agreement was a secret pact signed in May 1916 between the United Kingdom and France during World War I. The agreement's signatories were Sir Mark Sykes, on behalf of the United Kingdom, and François Georges-Picot, representing France. The agreement was named after these two diplomats.
The main objective of the Sykes-Picot Agreement was to define the spheres of influence and territorial interests of the Allied powers in the Middle East should they succeed in defeating the Ottoman Empire, which was allied with the Central Powers in the war. The agreement proposed a territorial division of the region, outlining areas of British and French control and influence.
According to the Sykes-Picot Agreement, the areas designated for France included parts of southern Turkey, Syria, and Lebanon. At the same time, the United Kingdom would have control over Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq) and Palestine. Initially, part of the agreement was for Russia to receive a portion of northern Persia (modern-day Iran), although its ambitions were altered due to the Russian Revolution of 1917.
The borders established by the Sykes-Picot Agreement were largely ignored or modified by subsequent events, such as the Arab Revolt and the political changes that occurred after World War I. Still, its ramifications contributed to the shaping of the modern Middle East.

1917-1918
Conquest of the Jordan Valley (The Jewish Legion)
In mid-1915, Zionist leader Ze'ev Jabotinsky, motivated by his vision of the necessity for Jewish involvement in the struggle for the liberation of the Land of Israel and the importance of a Jewish self-defense organization in the region for the evolution of the Zionist movement, approached British authorities with a proposal to create a Jewish military unit to fight against the Ottoman Empire in Palestine.
Under his leadership and influence, the Jewish Legion was officially established in 1917, with British Colonel John Patterson as its commander. The following year, along with British forces, the new legion was sent to the eastern front of the conflict, where it played a crucial role in the Battle of Megiddo, part of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. The Jordan Valley was a strategic area in Palestine, and its conquest was vital for the Allies.
The Jewish Legion participated in various operations, including capturing Amman, the capital of Transjordan (modern-day Jordan), in March 1918. This success was one of the factors that contributed to the Ottoman defeat in the region. The Battle of Megiddo in September 1918 was decisive for the Allies and resulted in the Ottoman withdrawal and the eventual capture of Damascus.
The Jewish Legion's participation in the Jordan Valley's conquest during World War I was symbolically significant for the Jewish community, as it represented an active military contribution to the liberation of lands historically associated with the Jewish people. These events also had implications for the subsequent establishment of the British Mandate in Palestine and the developments that would lead to the declaration of the independence of the State of Israel in 1948.

1919
The Paris Peace Conference
The Paris Peace Conference of 1919 was a crucial milestone in redefining global borders after World War I, with direct consequences for the Middle East. During the conference, the victorious powers—primarily the United Kingdom and France—divided, in general terms, the territories of the former Ottoman Empire through the League of Nations' mandate system. These powers would take control of strategic regions such as Palestine and Iraq for the British and Syria and Lebanon for the French. This colonial partitioning process, with little significant consideration for local aspirations, sowed the seeds for numerous future conflicts in the region.
Regarding the Zionist movement, the conference played a vital role in establishing the foundations for the creation of the British Mandate for Palestine by the newly formed League of Nations (precursor to the UN), thereby ratifying the intentions of the British crown, which viewed “with favor the establishment of a national home for the Jewish people in Palestine” (Balfour Declaration, 1917).
Moreover, it was at this conference that Emir Faisal, a descendant of the Hashemite family Hussein and the official representative of the United Arab delegation, met with Chaim Weizmann, the official representative of the Zionist movement at the conference, and signed an agreement that, among other things, a) established that relations between Arabs and Jews in British Palestine would be collaborative and based on the Balfour Declaration; b) called for the vast and massive immigration of Jews to Palestine to create a strong community; and c) promised freedom of worship, given that Muslims would take care of their sacred places.

1920
The San Remo Conference
The San Remo Conference was a diplomatic meeting held in San Remo, Italy, from April 19 to 26, 1920. During this conference, the victorious Allied powers of World War I gathered to discuss and deliberate on the future of territories that belonged to the Ottoman Empire and were being divided among the winning powers following the war's end.
One of the most important decisions of the San Remo Conference was adopting the principle of assigning mandates to administer certain regions. The conference followed the principles outlined earlier in the Sykes-Picot Agreement, which delineated British and French spheres of influence in the Middle East.
In the specific context of Palestine, the San Remo Conference resulted in the assignment of the British Mandate over the region. The League of Nations formally approved this mandate of Nations on July 24, 1922. During the mandate period, which lasted until 1948, various issues related to the establishment of a Jewish national home in the region were addressed, including the implementation of the Balfour Declaration of 1917, which expressed British support for the creation of a "national home for the Jewish people" in Palestine.

1921
Cairo Conference
The Cairo Conference of 1921 was a meeting organized by the United Kingdom to discuss the administration of territories under the British Mandate in the Middle East, established after World War I, and to resolve the outstanding promises and controversies stemming from the McMahon-Hussein Letters (1915), the Sykes-Picot Agreement (1916), the Balfour Declaration (1917), and the San Remo Conference (1920). The meeting, chaired by Winston Churchill, occurred between March 12 and 30, 1921, in Cairo, Egypt.
One of its primary outcomes was the decision to divide the British Mandate of Palestine into two parts. The territory east of the Jordan River was separated to create the Emirate of Transjordan, now Jordan, governed by the Hashemite prince Abdullah. The area west of the Jordan River remained Palestine under British mandate, where Jewish immigration, as per the Balfour Declaration of 1917, would continue. The conference also consolidated the power of Faisal, Abdullah's brother, as king of the newly created Kingdom of Iraq in reward for his services during the Arab Revolt against the Ottomans.
According to David Ben-Gurion, who would later become Israel's first Prime Minister, "What was decided in Cairo was a new limitation on Jewish immigration. The Arabs have a numerical advantage that, if not contained, would jeopardize the Jewish future in Palestine" (Ben-Gurion, in Recollections). This growing insecurity regarding the future of Jews in Palestine, exacerbated by Arab resistance to immigration, contributed to tensions that would escalate in the following decades, culminating in increasingly frequent and violent conflicts (1920, 1921, and 1929) between the Arab and Jewish communities in the region.

1922
Transjordan Memorandum
	The Transjordan Memorandum, also known as the White Paper of 1922, was a document issued by the British government during its mandate over Palestine, in dissonance with the Balfour Declaration (1917) and the San Remo Conference (1920). The document stated that Transjordan (the area corresponding to the eastern bank of the Jordan River of British Palestine) would not be open to Jewish settlement and would be definitively excluded from the territory that would form the "national home for the Jewish people" in the region.
Following the memorandum, the eastern bank of the Jordan River became an emirate under the leadership of Emir Abdullah I, a member of the Hashemite dynasty, and maintained a protectorate relationship with the United Kingdom. In 1928, the League of Nations formally recognized the autonomy of Transjordan. This relationship evolved, and on May 25, 1946, Transjordan gained its independence, becoming an independent Arab state, the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.

1929
The Hebron Massacre
	The Hebron Massacre of 1929 was a violent conflict that occurred in the city of Hebron, in what was then British Mandate Palestine. The riot was one of the most tragic and bloody events during the period of the British Mandate and was primarily caused by tensions between Arab and Jewish communities.
In August 1929, unfounded rumors that Jews were planning to take control of the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem led to heightened tensions in the region. On August 23, 1929, an Arab mob attacked the Jewish community in Hebron, resulting in a violent pogrom. Local Arab groups killed and seriously injured many Jews, destroyed property, and looted Jewish homes and businesses.
The Hebron riot also spread to other areas, such as Safed and Jerusalem, resulting in hundreds of deaths and injuries on both sides. This event left a lasting mark on relations between Jewish and Arab communities in Palestine and contributed to the growing hostility between these groups.

1937
The Peel Commission
The Peel Commission was an inquiry committee appointed by the British government in 1936 and chaired by Lord Robert Peel to investigate the causes of the Arab revolt in Palestine and make recommendations about the region's future. In July of the following year, the Commission (composed exclusively of British leaders) issued its report, determining the impossibility of continuing British presence in Palestine and proposing the division of the territory into two distinct political entities: an Arab part and a Jewish part, with a small area around Jerusalem under international administration.
The proposal of the Peel Commission, known as the Peel Plan, was significant as it was one of the first official attempts to resolve the Arab-Jewish conflict in Palestine through territorial division. The plan outlined ten points for a fair division, which included, among other things, the exchange of land and populations and the granting of sacred sites.
However, both Arab and Jewish leaders rejected the plan for different reasons. The Arabs opposed the idea of partition outright, arguing that it was unjust and unacceptable. Jewish Zionist leaders, while willing to accept the idea of a Jewish state in only part of the original territory, rejected the Peel Plan due to the minimal extent of the areas proposed for the future Jewish state.

1939
The White Paper - "Palestine Policy Statement"
	The White Paper of 1939, officially known as the "Palestine Policy Statement," was a policy established during the British Mandate in Palestine. Issued in May 1939, the White Paper reflected a significant shift in British policy in the region, particularly regarding Jewish immigration and the establishment of a Jewish state.
The main points of the declaration included the establishment of a drastically limited quota for the number of entry permits for the Jewish population and restrictions on the sale of land to Jews. The new terms contradicted those established in the Balfour Declaration and ratified by the League of Nations in Paris (1919), and San Remo (1920), and they were fatal for thousands of Jews seeking to escape the murderous intentions of Nazi policies already in place across much of Europe.

1947
Resolution 181 - United Nations General Assembly - "Partition of Palestine"
	The UN Partition of 1947 refers to the plan proposed by the United Nations General Assembly to divide the British Mandate in Palestine into two independent states, a Jewish state and an Arab state, in line with the (failed) attempts of the Peel Commission. This plan was presented as UN General Assembly Resolution 181. It was adopted on November 29, 1947, with thirty-three votes in favor (including the United States and the Soviet Union), thirtheen votes against (mostly from Arab countries like Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq, which immediately declared war against the newly formed State of Israel following the British withdrawal), and ten abstentions.
The partition plan proposed the creation of a Jewish state and an Arab state, with Jerusalem being internationalized and administered by UN forces. The idea was to resolve the ethnic and religious tensions in the region by providing two states for the local Jewish and Arab communities.
Jewish leaders accepted the plan, but the Arab League rejected it, arguing that the partition was unjust. The respective responses led to a period of conflict and eventually to the Israeli War of Independence in 1948, which began after the declaration of independence of the State of Israel on May 14 of that year.
