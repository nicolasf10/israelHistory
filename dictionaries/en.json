The capture of Jerusalem by the Muslims occurred in 637 CE, during the caliphate of the second caliph, Omar ibn al-Khattab.",

The Arab caliphs adopted an approach of inter-religious coexistence, recognizing Jewish and Christian traditions. Although they were subject to special taxes (jizya), Jews were generally free to practice their faith and engage in community affairs. This period witnessed a cultural and intellectual renaissance, with Jewish scholars contributing to the region's flourishing of arts, sciences, and philosophy."

The Crusades took place over two centuries (1096 to 1291) and aimed to regain political and religious control of the Holy Land. The beginning of Christian control over the Land of Israel (intermittent and unstable) is commonly marked by the conquest of Jerusalem during the First Crusade in 1099, which until then was under the control of the Fatimid Empire (Arab-Muslim).",

There were many geopolitical changes during this period, especially during the four main Crusades.",

This crusade was an attempt to renew the fight after the fall of Jerusalem to Saladin in 1187 during the Third Crusade. However, the Crusade of the Poor was unsuccessful in reclaiming Jerusalem; instead, it captured some coastal cities in the region, such as Caesarea and Jaffa. The advance inland, including to Jerusalem, was impeded, and the Crusaders failed to establish a lasting presence in the region. This event is considered one of the last organized attempts by Christian forces to reclaim territories in the Holy Land during the Crusades.",

Jewish communities grew but were also targets of violence, facing massacres and pogroms, especially during the First Crusade. Despite the tensions, there were moments of relative coexistence, especially under Muslim rulers, allowing Jews to participate in trade and cultural life."

The peak of these expulsions occurred in 1956, during the Suez Crisis. Of the nine hundred thousand Jews forced to leave their homes, around 650,000 were absorbed by the State of Israel between 1948 and 1979.

This agreement aimed not to establish permanent borders but to cease hostilities and define temporary demarcation lines until a final deal could be reached. These limits became known as the \"Green Line\" and served as a starting point and reference in various territorial negotiations over the years.",

Additionally, Hamat Gader and Snir (on the northeastern coast of the Sea of Galilee), which were supposed to be Israeli, remained under Syrian military control.",

East Jerusalem (including the Old City and the holy sites) and the West Bank were captured by the Hashemite Emirate of Transjordan, while Egypt occupied the Gaza Strip. The other Arab state was never established. From this point on, the region historically known as Judea and Samaria became known as the West Bank — in contrast to Transjordan, referring to the banks of the Jordan River. The newly independent Kingdom's attempt to annex the region was recognized only by Pakistan, Iraq, and the United Kingdom and never gained legal validity in the international community.",

Article 2 states: \"It is also recognized that no provision of this agreement shall in any way prejudice the rights, claims, and positions of either party in the peaceful final settlement of the Palestinian question. The provisions of this agreement are dedicated exclusively to military considerations.\" Thus, it is correct to argue that the Green Line is only relevant regarding the law of war and where the parties would refrain from conflict.",

One of the worst attacks was committed by a member of Islamic Jihad in 1989, who blew up a bus on line 405, killing 16 people. To combat these groups, Israel intensified its military presence in the areas where they operated, imposed curfews, and, in extreme cases, organized deportations.

Soon after the clashes, the two groups staged coups, self-determining as the rulers, authoritatively, in their respective regions.",
                "In response to the undemocratic takeover by the terrorist group Hamas in the Gaza Strip, the Israeli government imposed a series of import restrictions, which are in accordance with international law."

By the end of the conflict, Hezbollah was significantly weakened; however, there were many civilian casualties on both sides, especially among the Lebanese.",

After 36 meetings with Palestinian leadership between 2006 and 2008, the final proposal was similar to what Barak offered at Camp David, with the addition of a specific body to manage the holy sites, a bridge—exclusively for Palestinians—linking Gaza and Judea and Samaria, and territory equivalent to 100% of Judea and Samaria, with a 6% territorial \"swap.\" The new leader of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, did not respond to the proposal."

                "In 2008, then-Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert presented a peace proposal to the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), led by Mahmoud Abbas. This proposal was considered one of the most comprehensive ever made, offering around 93-94% of the West Bank for the establishment of a future Palestinian state. To compensate for the 6-7% of West Bank territory that Israel wanted to annex (including large blocs of Jewish settlements, marked in gray on the map), Olmert proposed a land swap, offering an equivalent area within Israel's sovereign territory (marked in beige on the map). Additionally, the proposal included a secure corridor linking the West Bank and Gaza Strip, creating territorial continuity for the Palestinian state. The proposal also included a special shared sovereignty arrangement over the Old City of Jerusalem, with an international governance system for holy sites, such as the Temple Mount/Al-Aqsa compound.",
                "",
                "In territorial terms, Olmert's proposal differed from previous plans by offering Palestinians nearly the entire West Bank while aiming to retain strategic areas near Jerusalem and some larger settlements, compensated by land within Israel. Regarding Palestinian refugees, Olmert made a limited offer for a symbolic \"return\" of some to Israel, while other refugees could be resettled in the future Palestinian state or other countries with international financial support. The proposal also called for the demilitarization of the future Palestinian state, ensuring Israel's security along shared borders.",
                "",
                "Olmert’s plan emerged from a phase of intense negotiations and his desire to advance the peace process after previous negotiations had stalled. However, the agreement never materialized, as Abbas never provided a formal response before Olmert left office amid a corruption investigation. The proposal, though never implemented, is often cited as a significant missed opportunity in attempts to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Additionally, the start of the Lebanon War in 2006 also halted progress in negotiations; this war was triggered by the kidnapping of Israeli soldiers by Hezbollah and involved intense fighting between Israel and the Lebanese terrorist group, which was supported by Iran and Syria."

These accords marked a significant shift in the Arab-Israeli conflict, as they established that peace with the Palestinians is no longer seen as a prerequisite for peace with Arab nations. Instead, it is now viewed as something that these agreements will bolster.",
                "The accords also included provisions for economic cooperation, security arrangements, and cultural exchanges, indicating a broader commitment to mutual interests. However, reactions from the Palestinian Authority and other Arab nations highlighted tensions, with many viewing the agreements as a betrayal of the Palestinian cause.",
                "The next step that Israel intended to take was to achieve normalization of relations with Saudi Arabia, the leader of Sunni countries and one of the most powerful nations in the Arab world. However, the war with Hamas, following the brutal surprise attack initiated by the terrorist group on October 7, 2023, interrupted discussions between the two countries, which are expected to resume after the conflict ends."
